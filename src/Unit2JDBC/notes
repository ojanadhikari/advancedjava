JdbcRowSet:

JdbcRowSet is a connected row set, meaning it maintains a connection to the database while it is in use.
The JdbcRowSetImpl is initialized with the database connection details and the SQL command.
It is then executed using jdbcRowSet.execute(), and data is retrieved in a similar way to ResultSet.


CachedRowSet:

CachedRowSet is a disconnected row set, which means it can operate without maintaining a continuous connection to the database.
After retrieving data into the ResultSet, the CachedRowSet is populated using cachedRowSet.populate(rs).
Once populated, the CachedRowSet can be used independently of the database connection.
