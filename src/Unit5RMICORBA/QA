1. What is RMI?
RMI is a mechanism that allows an object residing in one Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to invoke methods on an object in another JVM.

2. The Roles of Client and Server
Server: Creates and exports a remote object.
Client: Obtains a reference to the remote object and invokes methods on it.

4. Stubs and Parameter Marshalling
Stub: The client-side proxy for the remote object, which forwards method calls to the server.
Parameter Marshalling: The process of packing parameters into a format suitable for transmission over the network.

5. The RMI Programming Model
Interfaces and Implementations: The remote interface extends java.rmi.Remote. The server class implements this interface.
RMI Registry: A simple naming service that allows clients to obtain a reference to a remote object.
6. Parameters and Return Values in Remote Methods
RMI supports passing of primitive data types, serializable objects, and remote object references as parameters.

7. Remote Object Activation
Activation allows RMI servers to be started on demand when a client request is made.

8. Simple Client/Server Application using RMI
The example provided above is a simple client/server application using RMI.

9. Comparing RMI with CORBA
RMI: Java-specific, easier to use, but limited to Java applications.
CORBA: Language-independent, more complex, supports integration across different languages.


RMI (Remote Method Invocation)
Language: Primarily Java. It allows Java objects to invoke methods on other Java objects located remotely.
Complexity: Simpler to use for Java applications since it's tightly integrated with the Java language and JVM.
Object-Oriented: It uses Java’s object-oriented features and is designed to work within the Java ecosystem.
Serialization: Java RMI uses Java’s built-in serialization to handle object transmission.
Use Case: Ideal for Java-to-Java applications where the communication is mostly between Java objects.

CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture)
Language: Language-agnostic. CORBA allows communication between objects written in different programming languages.
Complexity: More complex compared to RMI, as it requires an Interface Definition Language (IDL) to define the interfaces, and involves more setup and configuration.
Object-Oriented: Designed to work across different languages and platforms, not limited to a single language or ecosystem.
Serialization: CORBA uses a custom serialization format and its own Object Request Broker (ORB) to handle communication.
Use Case: Suitable for heterogeneous environments where different programming languages or platforms need to interact.

Comparison Summary
Ease of Use: RMI is easier to use for Java developers, while CORBA can handle a wider range of languages and platforms but is more complex.
Interoperability: CORBA provides better support for interoperability between different programming languages.
Performance: RMI might be simpler and faster within Java environments, but CORBA’s performance can be influenced by its broader scope and additional overhead.
