Background
Servlets: Java classes that handle requests and generate responses, usually for web applications.
JSP (JavaServer Pages): A technology that helps create dynamically generated web pages based on HTML, XML, or other document types.


The Life Cycle of a Servlet
Loading and Instantiation: The servlet container loads the servlet class and instantiates it.
Initialization: The init() method is called by the container to initialize the servlet.
Request Handling: The service() method is called to handle requests. This method then calls doGet(), doPost(), etc., based on the type of HTTP request.
Destruction: The destroy() method is called before the servlet is taken out of service.
